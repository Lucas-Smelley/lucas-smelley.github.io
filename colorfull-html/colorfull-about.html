        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p class="center-text">ColorFull is a game centered around customization. You are able to change most aspects of the game while playing. Experimenting with different settings and trying different combinations of settings to see whats cool is the main purpose of the game. There is also the optional challege of collecting treasures, and avoiding enemies, but these can be disabled.</p>

The code that changes the game shadow depending on the distance from the treasure uses a technique called linear interpolation, or lerp.
